## ContactsCar 

This Flutter project is a GitHub repositories viewer that allows you to explore repositories, toggle between light and dark themes, and implement pagination for efficient data loading. Additionally, you can search for specific repositories.

## Features

- Fetch a list of popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) API using Dio and display them in a 
list.
- Each item in the list should display the movie's title, release date, and poster image.
- Implement pagination to efficiently load and display movies.
- Implement local data caching using Hive to store the fetched movie data in the app's local database.
